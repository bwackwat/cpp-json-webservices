<h2>Greetings! You found my personal site.</h2>
<p>I am a software professional, an adventurer, and a thinker.</p>
<p>On this site you can find a timeline of my software history, a climbing log, and a contact form.</p>
<p>If you are really curious, check out the about section or go to <a href="https://www.bwackwat.com/">bwackwat.com</a>. There, you can find my incomplete blog (with tech-related posts,) and other apps which I've designed. I hope you find some interesting things!</p>
<br>
<p>Please contact me if you'd like as well, stress free.</p>
