<p>My history as a software geek began as an object-oriented fiend of Java, and has progressed far since.</p>
<p>I have worked largely with C, C++, C#, (.NET, ) Java, Scala, Python, JavaScript, Unix Shell, PowerShell, *web languages*, LC-3, and CL.</p>
<p>Below is a timeline.</p>

<h2>2006 - 2010</h2>
<p>
High school was a time for me not only to play lots of video games, but to deepen my understanding of how they worked on the inside. On one hand I created maps in Warcraft III and designed low-level game features using "triggers" and the JASS scripting language, and on the other I experimented heavily with Java using NetBeans. During these years I made dozens of sample Java applications, many of which failed to produce anything worthy. I investigated and used Java Swing, data structures, algorithms, file I/O, and even some socket and servlet programming. Perhaps some day the more valuable projects will be available on this site. As a sophomore, a group of classmates and I from a Computer Science course won the 2008 <a href="http://proceedings.ndia.org/stem/ayers.pdf">NDIA STEM TeamDefend Competition</a>! It was really fun I learned some odd things about supercomputers hacking every slightly-vulnerable Windows Server 2003 service. You can see a photo of my team <a href="media/teamdefendvictory.JPG">here</a>. I'm the long-hair.

<h2>2004 - 2006</h2>
<p>
During these anxiety ridden years of steady maturing, I was introduced to the C++ programming language by a brilliant old friend who is currently finishing his degree at MIT. I learned about polymorphism, variables, methods, language syntax, APIs, and other cryptic fundamentals such as stdin/stdout and cin/cout. He and I worked together on a few rudimentary projects which users enjoyed a tree of paths (text RPG) and responded to queries, all in the console. I was already very excited about the possibilities, but I had no idea how far down this rabbit hole went.

<h2>1992 - 2004</h2>
<p>
I was born and quickly grew into enjoying Windows 95/98 video games such as Mech Warrior, Uprising, and Lemmings. I remember playing old Macintosh Apple games and other ancient games on Windows 3.0. I progressed as Windows XP came out into excellent releases such as Starcraft, Warcraft III (TFT), Unreal Tournament 2004, Half-Life 2, and Doom 3. In the back of my mind the whole time I wondered how these worlds and scenes were getting rendered. I thought about the filesystem, the internet, and the operating systems often.
